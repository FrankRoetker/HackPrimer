## Intro

This project is an example project for a talk that I gave to the Rose-Hulman Hackers Club on the 1st of April, 2014. It is a web app diary for my roommate Elijah Beard so that he can share is deepest darkest secrets. 

The accompanying presentation can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DdF4emj6abN8JWa-jfO2NDjs5eO2IpGKJevpC7bHMiQ/edit#slide=id.g1df17284e_033).

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to give an example project to students to are interested in the MEAN stack but might not know anything about the individual components or the stack as a whole. This will be a staring point for beginners to make simple changes to a working project and see the effects of their changes.

This project is simple enough to use as an introduction of the MEAN stack whilst touching on all of the components.
